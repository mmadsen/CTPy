    :synopsis: Data object for storing a sample of N individuals (and their genotypes) in MongoDB, via the Ming ORM.

.. moduleauthor:: Mark E. Madsen <mark@madsenlab.org>

This data object and database collection holds individual samples that have been constructed from raw individual_samples
by subsampling, to fill out every desired level of dimensionality and sample size.
